# URSSA-MINER
 An autonomous, wireless soil sampling robotic arm. Created for an AP Physics C project in grade 12. 

## Description
A camera atop the arm will stream a live view of the area in front of the arm to the GUI. Users can select a location, and the arm will move to that location, scoop up some soil, and return it to the base of the arm where the sensors are. The sensor readings are then sent back and displayed on the GUI. All communication between the arm and the user is wireless.
